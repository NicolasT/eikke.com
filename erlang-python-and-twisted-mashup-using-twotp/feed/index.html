		<description>Also, if you&#039;ve downloaded release 0.7, you&#039;ll probably need to apply the fix suggested here:

		<description>@sl63 I&#039;m mostly in the same camp with the point you are making, but you might have presented it in a less snide way.  The presentation _is_ excellent, so thanks for posting it.  I&#039;m interested in using Twopt to manage RabbitMQ *locally*, as using this technique is far better than, say, scripting shell calls to &quot;rabbitmqctl&quot;.  Until other solutions come along, this is a perfect way of solving some immediate problems.</description>

		<description>Yep, Erlang and Python could become like &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/file?path=/qcon-london-2009/slides/SteveVinoski_RPCAndItsOffspringConvenientYetFundamentallyFlawed.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Peanut Butter and Jelly&lt;/A&gt; for web programming.</description>

		<description>Yes, thanks to Nicolas for posting this article - it prompted me to realize how awesome Twotp is.  I&#039;m personally going to be using it for some RabbitMQ management, but connecting (in a first class citizen type of way) to any sort of Erlang node from twisted (like Ejabberd, etc) is powerful.  Also, I&#039;d like to mention that last night I talked with Thomas Hervé (author of Twotp) on the #twisted irc channel (he is &#039;therve&#039;) and he was extremely helpful.  Furthermore, I noticed by the next morning a small bug was fixed and a couple great examples were added to Twotp, so I recommend getting the latest source.</description>

		<description>Thanks a lot for this post! I&#039;m Twotp author, and I&#039;d be happy to help you if you have some questions. It&#039;s a side project and I don&#039;t spend much time on it nowadays, but I&#039;d like to spend more!</description>

		<description>Very nice.  I just came across your work.  I&#039;ve been working on something similar for Ruby using Eventmachine.   I haven&#039;t had the opportunity to look though all the code yet; but have you tackled &quot;links&quot; yet?</description>
