		<description>I&#039;ve been thinking about how many small companies are using FLOSS to manage their systems every day.
It would be great if such a list exists.</description>

		<description>There is an older &#039;free software business&#039; mailing list at http://www.crynwr.com/fsb/ Might be a little too open-registration for you, though; might instead want to follow the http://flossfoundations.org/ model and only do invite-only until a list culture is established that you&#039;re comfortable with.</description>

		<description>I remember a posting on p.g.o about founding an open source business network (not sure who wrote the post), where companies would participate as partners. Don&#039;t know if this ever took off (I&#039;m guessing no, else ther&#039;d be more noise around it), but something that got me interested. I&#039;d love to see this, and I&#039;m betting that it would serve well for handing over business opportunities.</description>
