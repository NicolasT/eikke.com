		<description>The concept is great, in fact KDE4 is the first windowing system of any that makes sense. The problem is it has alot of bugs. Sessions dont save, widgets always have to be reopened etc. But the concept of a non obtrusive desktop is hopefully finally arrived. I gave up on X Window apps because they just werent there, and switched finally to Mac. Loved Macs simpicity, and then found KDE4 and now I think my MacOS gui is child&#039;s play. KDE4 team has alot of fine tuning to do, but really, they have found the answer. Good job.</description>

		<description>I am a big fan of KDE, since I first installed linux. I installed KDE 4 only some days ago, and the truth is that although it is innovative it has still long way to go. First of all, I didn&#039;t like this only-widgets thing. It would be better if KDE kept some features of the previous version, like the panels, and of course the ability to customize them. Another thing I noticed (I am not sure about that, since I&#039;ve been using KDE 4 for about 2 days now), is that you can&#039;t use some applications of the previous version of KDE. From my limited experience with the new KDE desktop I also found it more difficult to customize it&#039;s look and feel, and not in the same extend as the previous version.</description>

		<description>David, Anonymous: regarding the zoom button, I can only (just like every &quot;normal&quot; user) judge what I got in front of me, a day-by-day user won&#039;t check any source code to know whether the feature is standard. If a distribution ships a package which feature X enabled, an end-user interprets this as a standard feature of X.

Anonymous: regarding the floppy thing, I&#039;ll check lshal and dmesg the next time I boot the VM.

Stoffe: your words, not mine ;-)

troll: actually, come check my hard drive performance. Even launching TWM in a simple X server using startx on a cold cache takes several seconds. On a hot cache it takes about 1s.

Markus: I wanted this to be a fair review (I try never to be unfair, especially on things lots of people work on for fun). Great this was noticed, thanks a lot for the pleasant comment!</description>

		<description>Beautiful bootsplash? Bootsplashes as a concept are entirely broken. There is absolutely no sane reason why a software couldn&#039;t boot up fast enough so that you wouldn&#039;t have to entertain the end user while waiting for it.</description>

		<description>KDE: All functions with no thought
GNOME: All thought with no functions

That&#039;s how it used to be. Now GNOME has most - but not all - the functionality, but KDE still has very little thought... that is my impression from KDE 4. And seeing all the excuses about how a major version number isn&#039;t meant for public consumtion etc etc etc etc etc etc, the KDE people know it too.</description>

		<description>One additional note, to call this a &quot;KDE 4.0 Review&quot; when you&#039;re basically only looking at two of the changed pieces (plasma and system settings) is a joke.</description>
