		<description>Hmm, you are making it difficult to contact you. I am urgently looking for Java programmers, but don&#039;t want to log on or get LinkedIn. If you are free to work, let me know.</description>

		<description>Actually this article and your comments come as a relief to me.  I just had a really bad interview where my experience (including team lead of a successful application), passion, and more were thrown to the side and all the questions and so forth seemed to be targeting my schooling and stuff (which is currently without a degree).  It was a terrible interview for what seemed like a good job and I&#039;ve had been less confident since.  

I just wish everyone valued programmers like this since I definitley fit in this category (passionate and always trying something new).  I&#039;m also going to school but that has been second to my programming jobs.</description>

		<description>You&#039;re completely right, Benjamin, didn&#039;t think of that scenario. A sad truth though.</description>

		<description>&gt; Maybe the best way to know whether someone applying for 
&gt; a position in the IT department at your company is to ‘throw
&gt; him in front of the wolves’
&gt;
That suggestion has one big problem. It assumes you have the right people already. If you&#039;re just starting a company (the example from Paul Graham) you don&#039;t have any people they&#039;ll work with yet. And if your programmers are all mediocre, they&#039;ll not want to work with people that are better than them, so they&#039;ll not recommend hiring the really good ones.</description>

		<description>That&#039;s how our social systems work, I guess? Whether you or I like it or not, in some circumstances you do need this piece of paper (=&gt; diploma), I won&#039;t be able to change this, neither will you.</description>

		<description>Boy do I sympathize with that &quot;(no degree yet, maybe I won’t ever get one)&quot;. 
I&#039;ll go even further to say that the difference between a good student and a bad student is the difference between a sheep and a persistent sheep. Both are still part of the herd, you see.
Look, I&#039;m not implying good programmers don&#039;t have degrees. I&#039;m just saying the only reason someone goes to university in the first place is due to hereditary prejudices. The biggest fear of a human being is becoming a misfit. I just happen to think it&#039;s a risky prejudice, because someone good at something gets compared with someone who&#039;s not on the same grounds, for the most part. Or at least a significant one.</description>

		<description>Philip: you&#039;re right, although maybe you&#039;re missing one point too: not everyone wants to stay in the programming business until he retires. I don&#039;t. At the stage you want to stop doing programming jobs, and get into new things (both related and unrelated to IT), the absence of a degree can have a major impact on hiring success.</description>

		<description>Regarding the degree bit: I have no degree and I&#039;ve been working as a full-time developer for various companies for seven years now.  Only once has someone asked me why no degree was mentioned on my CV and what degrees I had.  I asked the man if he wanted a programmer with the embedded and kernel experience he was looking for, or one with a certain kind of degree.  Needless to say, I got the project.  I&#039;ve been on the project for the last fourteen months and not once have I (or anyone else, I think) felt that a degree is really missing from my personal baggage.

While I have nothing but admiration for people who manage to suffer through X years of university, I would always give the benefit of the doubt to applicants without a degree.  Not just because I &#039;sympathize&#039; with them, but because it shows willingness to leave the trodden path.  A feature I find admirable in a programmer but which the author of the cited article neglects to mention explicitly.</description>

		<description>Sadly enough it looks like inter-sections.net is down... You can check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:-PJEtsLZfV8J:www.inter-sections.net/2007/11/13/how-to-recognise-a-good-programmer/+inter-sections+programmer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google Cache version&lt;/a&gt; though.</description>
