		<description>Hey just looking around at the landscape with python and couchdb.  I see your project hasn&#039;t been touched since 2007.  Is it still live and well?  What&#039;s the story?

Thanks, and great website!</description>

		<description>I updated your client.py to comply with version 0.8 and PEP8. Just drop me a mail if you are interested. Anyway, I&#039;ll have a look if it&#039;s possible to merge it with python-couchdb.

		<description>Hi this looks really interesting, I was wondering if couchdb might help with searching and ranking documents based on keywords. I should read up on the couchdb documentation since I know nothing about it.  

I&#039;m looking at a news site that was built using Sphinx Search, http://drupal.org/node/261340 and several Drupal modules. Now I&#039;m wondering how you can do something like this in Django/Python.  I can surely use Sphinx regardless of what powers the views (php or python) but I&#039;m noticing more talk about couchdb from the python community.  

Anyway, just wondering if you might have a take on this, thanks.</description>
