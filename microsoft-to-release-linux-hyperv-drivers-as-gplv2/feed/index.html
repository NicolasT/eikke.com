		<description>You should&#039;ve looked at the patches, looks like MS couldn&#039;t let go of its coding style conventions and follow the Linux kernel coding style :)</description>

		<description>&quot;This saga started when one of the user&#039;s on the Vyatta forum inquired about supporting Hyper-V network driver in the Vyatta kernel. A little googling6 found the necessary drivers, but on closer examination there was a problem. The driver had both open-source components which were under GPL, and statically linked to several binary parts. The GPL does not permit mixing of closed and open source parts, so this was an obvious violation of the license. Rather than creating noise, my goal was to resolve the problem, so I turned to Greg Kroah-Hartman7. Since Novell has a (too) close association with Microsoft, my expectation was that Greg could prod the right people to get the issue resolved.&quot;

		<description>in your link from lkml we can read:
&quot;(...) thank the following
people who made this possible:
 - (...)
 - Novell for sponsoring my work on the Linux Driver project, without
    which, this would not have even been possible.
(...)&quot;

I think Greg is the person that novell is sponsoring to develop kernel drivers &quot;for free&quot;, n resquest from vendors.</description>

		<description>Kernel drivers indeed.  Non-GPL kernel drivers are written anyway, although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Kernel_Driver_Statement&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;being discouraged&lt;/a&gt;, obviously. That&#039;s why the kernel has both EXPORT_SYMBOL and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL macros, check an &lt;a href=&quot;http://lwn.net/Articles/154602/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LWN article&lt;/a&gt; related to this.</description>

		<description>So those are kernel drivers, right? So tell me which other license they shall have chosen for kernel drivers? AFAIK usung another license but GPL (and maybe BSD - IANAL) is grey area and asking for trouble when it comes to kernel drivers.</description>
