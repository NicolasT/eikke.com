		<description>I&#039;d say, the question about what language and what library (wrapper about what we want to expose) to use, depends a bit on who we want to empower. And what we want or expect them to do.
I suppose we do _not_ want to integrate scripting, to get users to write complex applications. Then they can already use python/C# or some language mono supports. (But maybe they will write complex apps, who knows ...)
So in my eyes it only makes sense to use some untyped language like JavaScript or lua, because python and c#(as an synonym..) can already be used. They are  not really embed but got many bindings.
Oh and: If we want the users to really use scripting, we will have to offer tools (places here and there to code, validate, console, quick manual, easy way to integrate into apps[plugin..], ...) as Benjamin Otte already said.</description>

		<description>Yeah, cannot disagree with that. As a scripting language I think JavaScript is nice, although I would prefer python. However, I do not want JavaScript to be the language-of-the-future, I do not want to write large applications in it or have it as the single choice. That is however another discussion and perhaps my I&#039;m-sick-of-writing-apps-in-loosely-typed-languages-feeling spread into the wrong area here. 

We&#039;ve come to accept JavaScript as the language in web browsers, because it is somewhat embraced by W3C, but from my point of view, I see no reason why GNOME should care about this instead of choosing a superior technology, which has a lot of developers in the Windows world -- which from what I can understand is the world we want to get/take our users from, so why not use something familiar to them.</description>

		<description>in response to marcus:

I did not want to use popularity to judge about the design of a language. Personally I quite like JavaScript.
I just thought that there should libraries to ease the scripting of GUI components. This might help, to increase the language&#039;s popularity within GNOME. 
My thumb rule: Less lines result in fancy things: More popular!</description>

		<description>in response to fabian:

do you think that a language is good/well designed if it isn&#039;t popular until libraries exist that completely changes how you use it, almost to the point of changing the syntax?</description>

		<description>OR, perhaps, you could use a standardized bytecode &quot;language&quot; with support for multiple comiplers/languages of which a whole bunch are scripting/dynamic languages. 

Ok. Can anyone say &quot;MONO&quot; (!!!)</description>

		<description>JavaScript has been around for some time. I suppose that it&#039;s recent success is much because of the work gone into all those JS Libraries (jquery, prototype.js).
I suppose that we will have to provide something similar, a library matching GNOME/UI needs and enabling RAD (like jquery,.. do).</description>

		<description>I&#039;d rather have only one language, even if it&#039;s Ruby (which I never looked at). Learning a scripting language isn&#039;t rocket science, and I believe that &quot;learnability&quot; would far more benefit from a centralized pool of information.</description>

		<description>The barrier of entry to JS is low, with lots of tutorials abounding.  The effort required to maintain all the packages in all the languages is monumental.</description>
