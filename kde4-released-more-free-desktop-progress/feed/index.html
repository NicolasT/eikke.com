		<description>Find another ISP ;-)

I&#039;ve tried a KDE4 (RC or something) live cd a while ago. I Expected something a bit more stable. But hey it looked nice.</description>

		<description>Panel in KDE3 is adjustable. Minimum is 24 pixels. And in KDE4 it will be adjustable too.</description>

		<description>Jonas: I might not like wide panels, but I truly hate auto-hiding panels :-) Anyway, everyone got his preferences I guess.</description>

		<description>Dunno about KDE4, as I haven&#039;t explored it in enough detail yet (and I will hold off upgrading my main system to it until at least 4.1), but the panel in KDE3 waste exactly zero pixels on my desktop.

It only shows up whenever I want it to (which is quite rarely really). I access my applications menu by right-clicking on the desktop,and the panel shows up only when I let the mouse pointer hover over where the panel is supposed to be.

Easy, and I would be surprised if KDE4 doesn&#039;t allow that. If not now, in a few updates it most likely will. So, I would say you&#039;re worried over nothing.

But you&#039;re right: the PDE will never exist. But it will certainly be interesting to see what you Gnome guys come up with in response. A healthy competition is always a good thing in my book :)</description>
