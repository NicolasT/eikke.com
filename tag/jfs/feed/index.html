			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, when shutting down my laptop (which had been up for quite a long time because of suspend/resume niceness), it crashed. I don&#8217;t know what exactly happened: pressed the GNOME&#8217;s logout button, applications were closed, until only my background was visible, then the system locked up, so I suspect my X server (some part of it, GPU driver (fglrx) might be the bad guy). I was able to sysrq s u o, so I thought everything would be relatively fine.</p>
<p>This morning I powered on my system, and while booting, fsck of some partitions was taking a rather long time. It&#8217;s pretty normal fsck was taking somewhat longer, but not th√°t long&#8230; I&#8217;m using JFS on most logical volumes.</p>
<p>When the consistency check of my /home partition was done, a whole load of invalid files was displayed and later on moved to lost+found: 34068 files. Once booted, I scanned my filesystems again, rebooted, logged in, started X. Everything started fine, until I launched Evolution: it presented my the &#8216;initial run&#8217; wizard. Other issues (on first sight): all Firefox cookies were gone, and Pidgin&#8217;s blist.xml was corrupted. When using my old computer (which had frequent lockups on heavy IO usage) these last 2 issues happened a lot too, which is highly annoying, especially the blist.xml thing as I can&#8217;t see any reason to keep this file opened for long periods?</p>
<p>Luckily I was able to get my Evolution up and running again by restoring it&#8217;s GConf settings and ~/.evolution using some old backup (15/10/07). I guess I should backup more regularly&#8230; Next to this I hope I won&#8217;t find any other corrupted files, so the ones in lost+found are just Evolution email files and Firefox caches.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a screenshot displaying some of the initial and hackish work I&#8217;ve done this evening on integrating <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com" title="Django">Django</a> and <a href="http://www.couchdb.org" title="CouchDB">CouchDB</a> as <a href="http://eikke.com/couchdb-with-python" title="Python, CouchDB and Python">I wrote about yesterday</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://eikke.com/filesystem-issues-and-django-couchdb-work/django-and-couchdb-first-shot-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-15" title="Django and CouchDB first shot"><img src="http://eikke.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/django_couchdb12.thumbnail.png" alt="Django and CouchDB first shot" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, currently I&#8217;m able to edit fields of an object. There&#8217;s one major condition: an object with the given ID should already exist in the &#8216;database&#8217; which makes the current code rather useless, but hey <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  I&#8217;ll add object creation functionality later tonight or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Current code is very expensive too, doing way too many queries to CouchDB, mainly in client.py. This most certainly needs work.</p>
<p>Upgraded my <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="WordPress">WordPress</a> installation to the latest release, 2.3.2, in about 5 seconds. Got to love svn switch (although maybe I should start using git-svn for this installation too and git-pull the release branch in my local copy).</p>
