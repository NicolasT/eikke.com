			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of buzz on adding scripting interfaces to applications on <a href="http://planet.gnome.org" title="Planet GNOME">Planet GNOME</a> recently, cool. Looks like <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/alexl" title="Alexander Larsson">Alexander Larsson</a> hacked together a wrapper around SpiderMonkey (the Mozilla Engine) to get JavaScript integrated. Related to the jscore-python thing I blogged about <a href="http://eikke.com/embedding-javascript-in-python/" title="Embedding JavaScript in Python - Ikke's Blog">before</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure this is the best way to tackle this cool new opportunity though. JavaScript can be pretty hard to &#8220;get&#8221; for people not used to it, but more familiar with classical languages (wrt object oriented paradigms). I guess lots of current code contributors are not very familiar with JavaScript, but do have an in-depth knowledge of some other scripting language though (not listing any here, you certainly can name some).</p>
<p>So, wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if the GScript interface would be abstract for the application developer, who should just create a script context, put some objects in it, and launch a script, after which the GScript runtime figures out which interpreter to use for this script, so scripting languages become plugable?</p>
<p>Reminds me a little of my old OPluginManager work <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/" title="KDE 4.0 release announcement">KDE4 was released today</a></strong>. Most likely not a big surprise for most readers, but hey <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Congratulations to the <a href="http://www.kde.org" title="KDE">KDE</a> team!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to give KDE 4 a test-run asap, been trying to download the <a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kde-four-live/" title="KDE 4.0 LiveCD">LiveCD ISO</a> to boot it in my <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" title="VirtualBox">VirtualBox</a> virtual machine, but the <a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kde-four-live/KDE-Four-Live.i686-1.0.torrent" title="KDE 4.0 LiveCD Torrent">torrent</a> is extremely slow here. Maybe <a href="http://www.skynet.be" title="Skynet">my ISP</a> also implemented BitTorrent bandwidth capping as iirc some others did in Belgium, which is completely unfair as this is, obviously, 100% legal content. Some of the screenshots I saw both during development phases and today do look pretty cool, especially taking into account I&#8217;m not a big fan of the KDE3.x look. I&#8217;m still a little afraid the bottom panel is very high (just like the KDE3.x one), which removes quite a lot of my precious display size&#8230; A 14.1 widescreen laptop isn&#8217;t th√°t big, using <a href="http://www.gnome.org" title="GNOME">GNOME</a> I only loose 2&#215;21 pixels.</p>
<p>One thing made me wonder: <a href="http://plasma.kde.org/" title="KDE Plasma">Plasma</a>, <a href="http://solid.kde.org/" title="KDE Solid">Solid</a>, <a href="http://phonon.kde.org/" title="KDE Phonon">Phonon</a>, <a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/applications.php" title="KDE 4.0 Applications">Dolphin, Okular</a>, <a href="http://pim.kde.org/akonadi/" title="KDE Akonadi">Akonadi</a>, <a href="http://oxygen-icons.org/" title="KDE Oxygen Icons">Oxygen</a>,&#8230; Where&#8217;s the K* guys? <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I remember some really long and heated threads on GNOME 3 (<a href="http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero" title="GNOME Project Topaz">Project Topaz</a>, which I still consider to be a great name) some months ago, maybe those should be revamped too, to keep the vibe alive <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Last couple of years have been very interesting Free Desktop-wise: we got more integration of system components, very flashy UI stuff, great new iconsets and themes, more stabilization of desktop components, several great and innovative new applications,&#8230; PDE (Perfect Desktop Environment) doesn&#8217;t exist yet (most likely it never will&#8230; does such a thing exist, after all?) but current projects are progressing very nicely, each with their proper strengths, targeted user base and features, which can only be applauded and stimulated. Keep on rocking, all of you, so the years ahead of us will be even more surprising, creative, constructive and <strong>fun</strong>!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, when shutting down my laptop (which had been up for quite a long time because of suspend/resume niceness), it crashed. I don&#8217;t know what exactly happened: pressed the GNOME&#8217;s logout button, applications were closed, until only my background was visible, then the system locked up, so I suspect my X server (some part of it, GPU driver (fglrx) might be the bad guy). I was able to sysrq s u o, so I thought everything would be relatively fine.</p>
<p>This morning I powered on my system, and while booting, fsck of some partitions was taking a rather long time. It&#8217;s pretty normal fsck was taking somewhat longer, but not th√°t long&#8230; I&#8217;m using JFS on most logical volumes.</p>
<p>When the consistency check of my /home partition was done, a whole load of invalid files was displayed and later on moved to lost+found: 34068 files. Once booted, I scanned my filesystems again, rebooted, logged in, started X. Everything started fine, until I launched Evolution: it presented my the &#8216;initial run&#8217; wizard. Other issues (on first sight): all Firefox cookies were gone, and Pidgin&#8217;s blist.xml was corrupted. When using my old computer (which had frequent lockups on heavy IO usage) these last 2 issues happened a lot too, which is highly annoying, especially the blist.xml thing as I can&#8217;t see any reason to keep this file opened for long periods?</p>
<p>Luckily I was able to get my Evolution up and running again by restoring it&#8217;s GConf settings and ~/.evolution using some old backup (15/10/07). I guess I should backup more regularly&#8230; Next to this I hope I won&#8217;t find any other corrupted files, so the ones in lost+found are just Evolution email files and Firefox caches.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a screenshot displaying some of the initial and hackish work I&#8217;ve done this evening on integrating <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com" title="Django">Django</a> and <a href="http://www.couchdb.org" title="CouchDB">CouchDB</a> as <a href="http://eikke.com/couchdb-with-python" title="Python, CouchDB and Python">I wrote about yesterday</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://eikke.com/filesystem-issues-and-django-couchdb-work/django-and-couchdb-first-shot-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-15" title="Django and CouchDB first shot"><img src="http://eikke.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/django_couchdb12.thumbnail.png" alt="Django and CouchDB first shot" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, currently I&#8217;m able to edit fields of an object. There&#8217;s one major condition: an object with the given ID should already exist in the &#8216;database&#8217; which makes the current code rather useless, but hey <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  I&#8217;ll add object creation functionality later tonight or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Current code is very expensive too, doing way too many queries to CouchDB, mainly in client.py. This most certainly needs work.</p>
<p>Upgraded my <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="WordPress">WordPress</a> installation to the latest release, 2.3.2, in about 5 seconds. Got to love svn switch (although maybe I should start using git-svn for this installation too and git-pull the release branch in my local copy).</p>
