			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Got a new cellphone today, a <a href="http://www.nokia.be/A4330105" title="Nokia 6300">Nokia 6300</a>. Pretty nice phone, except I can&#8217;t get the SyncML support to work on my Linux system&#8230; SyncML over OBEX is reported several times not to work, although the OpenSuSE wiki <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSync/SyncML-OBEX-Client">claims</a> it should work&#8230; Most sources say one should use the <a href="http://www.gnokii.org">gnokii</a> <a href="http://www.opensync.org">OpenSync</a> plugin, which does work, but has one major drawback: even when configuring the phone only to use it&#8217;s internal memory for contact list storage, the gnokii plugin will also sync the SIM content, which I copied to the phone memory. Result: duplication in my Evolution contact list. I guess I should patch libopensync-gnokii adding a configuration field providing the possibility to select only one storage container? Or try to figure out whether the Novell/SuSE guys have a patch for <a href="http://libsyncml.opensync.org">libsyncml</a>?</p>
<p>Does anyone know whether there&#8217;s a <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/">Tango</a>-style theme for this device? <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Little unrelated rant: thanks to my blog statistics I found out my recent <a href="http://eikke.com/django-generic-ajax-form-validation/">article on AJAX form validation with Django</a> got <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/info/64f3q/comments">featured</a> on <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/">programming.reddit.com</a>. I also saw some people commented on my article over there, comments on which I&#8217;ll reply later. Now I was wondering, why do people leave comments over there, and not beneath the blog entry, where everyone interested in the subject can easily find it, get into the discussion, the blog author will certainly read your comment, reply on it (as most likely he doesn&#8217;t read news-site X where user Y can post his comment, or news-site Z where Q posts his comments, etc, or he got no account on X or Z to be able to reply),&#8230; It&#8217;s as if I&#8217;d start my very own secret little webpage where I put links to all blog entries I want to comment on, and write the comment on that page, but don&#8217;t even do any trackback ping *sigh*</p>
<p>Oh and, those claiming AJAX form validation is bad: indeed, in some cases it is, except when you, eg, want to do &#8220;check username isn&#8217;t already registered&#8221;-style validation. If you&#8217;d have commented on the right place, we could have discussed this where it was appropriate.</p>
