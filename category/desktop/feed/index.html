			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of buzz on adding scripting interfaces to applications on <a href="http://planet.gnome.org" title="Planet GNOME">Planet GNOME</a> recently, cool. Looks like <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/alexl" title="Alexander Larsson">Alexander Larsson</a> hacked together a wrapper around SpiderMonkey (the Mozilla Engine) to get JavaScript integrated. Related to the jscore-python thing I blogged about <a href="http://eikke.com/embedding-javascript-in-python/" title="Embedding JavaScript in Python - Ikke's Blog">before</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure this is the best way to tackle this cool new opportunity though. JavaScript can be pretty hard to &#8220;get&#8221; for people not used to it, but more familiar with classical languages (wrt object oriented paradigms). I guess lots of current code contributors are not very familiar with JavaScript, but do have an in-depth knowledge of some other scripting language though (not listing any here, you certainly can name some).</p>
<p>So, wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if the GScript interface would be abstract for the application developer, who should just create a script context, put some objects in it, and launch a script, after which the GScript runtime figures out which interpreter to use for this script, so scripting languages become plugable?</p>
<p>Reminds me a little of my old OPluginManager work <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After switching to <a href="http://www.openoffice.org" title="OpenOffice">OpenOffice</a> in 2005 and introducing <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla">Mozilla</a> <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox" title="Mozilla Firefox">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird" title="Mozilla Thunderbird">Thunderbird</a> on their machines in 2006, the French paramilitary police (&#8216;Gendarmery&#8217;) will make the switch to 100% Free Software based desktops in the coming years. The migration should be completed in 2014.</p>
<p>All workstations will be converted to Ubuntu desktops, starting this year with 5000-8000 seats, growing to 12000-15000 over the next four years. By 2014, all 70000 (!!!) desktops should be running free software.</p>
<p>There are three major reasons for the full switch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove dependency on one single supplier</li>
<li> Gain full control over the whole operating system stack</li>
<li>Reduce costs</li>
</ol>
<p>Nowadays licensing costs sum up to 7000000€ (that&#8217;s seven million euros) every year.</p>
<p>I guess this must be one of the largest Linux desktops deployments ever?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been able to <a href="http://eikke.com/kde4-released-more-free-desktop-progress/">download the KDE4 LiveCD</a> by now, so I wanted to give it a test ride and write a basic <strong>KDE 4 review</strong>. These are my findings. I first and foremost want to stress I do not ever want to attack, offend or whatever anyone in this post (as reactions of vocal users on posts like these can be fierce sometimes <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ). These are my findings, both positive and negative.</p>
<p>One reason to read this until the end (in case you wouldn&#8217;t <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ):</p>
<p><a href="http://eikke.com/kde4-reviewed/kde-40-button-overflow/" rel="attachment wp-att-47" title="KDE 4.0 Button Overflow"><img src="http://eikke.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/lots_of_buttons.thumbnail.png" alt="KDE 4.0 Button Overflow" /></a></p>
<p>At first bootup the <a href="http://www.opensuse.org" title="OpenSuSE">OpenSuSE</a> bootsplash theme attracts your attention. I really like it, very smooth.</p>
<p>After a successful bootup (using <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" title="VirtualBox">VirtualBox</a> virtualization)  the <a href="http://www.kde.org" title="KDE">KDE</a> desktop starts. This takes a while, but this can be blamed on the use of a LiveCD, and a virtual machine. The splash screen is very clean, the use of black and rounded corners reminds me of <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple OS X</a> a little, don&#8217;t ask me why. The icon animation is nice, although I think the transparency shouldn&#8217;t go all the way to completely transparent (at least, that&#8217;s what it looks like), an maybe it should change somewhat slower. Next to this, the last icon in row (the KDE icon) is much bigger than the others, which doens&#8217;t look nice. Anyway, minor details.</p>
<p>Once booted, the user is presented with his desktop and a &#8216;Useful Tips&#8217; dialog:</p>
<p><a href="http://eikke.com/kde4-reviewed/kde-40-first-login/" rel="attachment wp-att-40" title="KDE 4.0 First login"><img src="http://eikke.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/initial_login.thumbnail.png" alt="KDE 4.0 First login" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-39"></span></p>
<p>One can immediately notice the new themeing (at least, compared to what I remember of KDE 3.5). The window borders are pretty nice (I like the fact they&#8217;re integrated with the window content, notice the curve on top), icons in the dialog are slick. One detail I really dislike is the use of centered text. No clue why this isn&#8217;t simply left-aligned.</p>
<p>Once the dialog is closed, one can explore the desktop. As I mentioned in <a href="http://eikke.com/kde4-released-more-free-desktop-progress/">my previous KDE 4 post</a>, I dislike the panel width. I could not figure out how to change this though: when right-clicking the panel in search of some &#8220;Properties&#8221; function, only panel applet-specific properties can be changed, and the panel border is not draggable. Maybe this setting is hidden somewhere else, but it&#8217;s not available in the (IMHO) most logical place.</p>
<p>There are 6 panel applets enabled by default: a menu (which integrates applications, places and system settings, as before, somewhat like the GNOME panel menu Novell created), a task manager, a desktop switcher, the clipboard manager, an applet to manage removable devices, and a clock.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a minor issue with the applet represented by the computer screen: unlike the other applets, when hovering with your mouse above it, no tooltip is displayed denoting what this icon is all about. I could only figure this out once clicking it.</p>
<p>On the upper right corner there&#8217;s a hotspot which allows the user to add widgets to his desktop, or to &#8216;Zoom out&#8217;:</p>
<p><a href="http://eikke.com/kde4-reviewed/kde-40-desktop-zoom-out-feature/" rel="attachment wp-att-41" title="KDE 4.0 Desktop zoom out feature"><img src="http://eikke.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/desktop_zoom_out.thumbnail.png" alt="KDE 4.0 Desktop zoom out feature" /></a></p>
<p>I, honestly, have no clue what the use of that is. Luckily you can zoom in again too, although the hotspot context menu is zoomed out to one quarter of its original size too, which is really small (actually, not readable). Bug?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/" title="KDE 4.0 release announcement">KDE4 was released today</a></strong>. Most likely not a big surprise for most readers, but hey <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Congratulations to the <a href="http://www.kde.org" title="KDE">KDE</a> team!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to give KDE 4 a test-run asap, been trying to download the <a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kde-four-live/" title="KDE 4.0 LiveCD">LiveCD ISO</a> to boot it in my <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" title="VirtualBox">VirtualBox</a> virtual machine, but the <a href="http://home.kde.org/~binner/kde-four-live/KDE-Four-Live.i686-1.0.torrent" title="KDE 4.0 LiveCD Torrent">torrent</a> is extremely slow here. Maybe <a href="http://www.skynet.be" title="Skynet">my ISP</a> also implemented BitTorrent bandwidth capping as iirc some others did in Belgium, which is completely unfair as this is, obviously, 100% legal content. Some of the screenshots I saw both during development phases and today do look pretty cool, especially taking into account I&#8217;m not a big fan of the KDE3.x look. I&#8217;m still a little afraid the bottom panel is very high (just like the KDE3.x one), which removes quite a lot of my precious display size&#8230; A 14.1 widescreen laptop isn&#8217;t thát big, using <a href="http://www.gnome.org" title="GNOME">GNOME</a> I only loose 2&#215;21 pixels.</p>
<p>One thing made me wonder: <a href="http://plasma.kde.org/" title="KDE Plasma">Plasma</a>, <a href="http://solid.kde.org/" title="KDE Solid">Solid</a>, <a href="http://phonon.kde.org/" title="KDE Phonon">Phonon</a>, <a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.0/applications.php" title="KDE 4.0 Applications">Dolphin, Okular</a>, <a href="http://pim.kde.org/akonadi/" title="KDE Akonadi">Akonadi</a>, <a href="http://oxygen-icons.org/" title="KDE Oxygen Icons">Oxygen</a>,&#8230; Where&#8217;s the K* guys? <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I remember some really long and heated threads on GNOME 3 (<a href="http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero" title="GNOME Project Topaz">Project Topaz</a>, which I still consider to be a great name) some months ago, maybe those should be revamped too, to keep the vibe alive <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Last couple of years have been very interesting Free Desktop-wise: we got more integration of system components, very flashy UI stuff, great new iconsets and themes, more stabilization of desktop components, several great and innovative new applications,&#8230; PDE (Perfect Desktop Environment) doesn&#8217;t exist yet (most likely it never will&#8230; does such a thing exist, after all?) but current projects are progressing very nicely, each with their proper strengths, targeted user base and features, which can only be applauded and stimulated. Keep on rocking, all of you, so the years ahead of us will be even more surprising, creative, constructive and <strong>fun</strong>!</p>
