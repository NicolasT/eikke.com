	<div class="entry-content full-content">
<p>As a programming-language adept I&#8217;ve been studying the ideas, concepts and theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> (FP) and FP-related languages for about 2 years now, still learning new things everyday.</p>
<p>Recently a &#8216;FP User Group&#8217; was started by some people at <a href="http://www.ugent.be/">Ghent University</a>, called GhentFPG, and the first meeting took place last thursday, with great interest from students, university employees as well as people working in the industry. You can find some more info in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ghent-fpg">GhentFPG Google Group</a> or in the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Ghent_Functional_Programming_Group">wiki</a> (where you can also find the slides of the presentations given during the first meeting).</p>
<p>Some days ago someone new to FP posted a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ghent-fpg/browse_thread/thread/81cee5d8c9a77266">message on the mailing list</a>, asking which language he should study, among other things.</p>
<p>Since I think my reply might be of general interest (also outside GhentFPG), I decided to post a copy on this blog as well (note I did add some extra markup). Comments welcome!</p>
<blockquote><p>
Based on my experience (which is biased, obviously):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Functional Programming is not only a language-related thing. FP<br />
languages do enforce you to apply functional paradigms, but you can<br />
easily follow these paradigms in lots of other (more mainstream?)<br />
languages as well: it is easier to learn people a paradigm using a<br />
language they already know, rather than telling them FP is really cool<br />
and useful and interesting, but requires them to learn a new<br />
language/toolchain/&#8230; first.</p>
<p>Not talking about <a href="http://www.java.net/">Java</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++">C++</a> or something similar here, rather <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a><br />
and <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>.</p>
<li>
<p>If you&#8217;re into Java/<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336809.aspx">C#</a>/&#8230;, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/"><em>Scala</em></a> is a really good introduction to FP:<br />
it allows you to write OOP code just like you do already, but also<br />
provides you lots of FP-related features, and pushes you gently into the<br />
FP approach. The book &#8220;Programming in Scala&#8221; by Odersky et al. (the main<br />
author of Scala) is IMO a really good intro to both Scala as well as the<br />
FP concepts it provides, not only showing them but also explaining<br />
gently why they&#8217;re useful, and why they&#8217;re &#8216;better&#8217; than the approaches<br />
you&#8217;re taking already.</p>
<p>The Scala type system is rather interesting as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the gentle path, so you want <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Learning Scala before reading<br />
&#8216;<a href="http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/">Real World Haskell</a>&#8216; certainly helped me a lot to understand the latter.</p>
<li>
<p><a href="http://haskell.org/"><em>Haskell</em></a> is an incredibly interesting language because of the concepts<br />
it adopted and types it provides, but it does require an immediate mind<br />
switch when coming from a non-OOP world (I once spent about 2 hours to<br />
explain a Java-guy how classes and instances in Haskell relate to<br />
classes and instances in Java, it wasn&#8217;t obvious). &#8220;Real World Haskell&#8221;<br />
is certainly worth a read (and if you read &#8220;Programming in Scala&#8221; as<br />
well, you&#8217;ll notice lots of similarities).</p>
<p>I for one can read Haskell code pretty easily and learned lots of<br />
CS/math things thanks to learning it, but I&#8217;m (still) unable to write<br />
non-trivial code (I need some good project to get my hands dirty I<br />
guess).</p>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.erlang.org/"><em>Erlang</em></a> is really interesting from a (very specific) feature<br />
perspective: high-availability, distributed computing, the actor system<br />
and the OTP library on top of it,&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rather &#8216;old&#8217; language, but I kind of like it. Some people do<br />
complain about the syntax, but once you figured out &#8216;,&#8217;, &#8216;;&#8217; and &#8216;.&#8217; are<br />
used almost the same as they are in &#8216;human&#8217; written language, everything<br />
becomes obvious  <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Do note though Erlang is not a normal general-purpose language. You can<br />
code +- everything you want using it, but it&#8217;s really targeted to<br />
distributed/high-available/network applications. You most likely won&#8217;t<br />
use it to solve mathematical problems or write a game. It&#8217;s really good<br />
at what it&#8217;s built for though.</p>
<p>One final note: please don&#8217;t ever make the mistake I made. If you know<br />
Erlang, and take a look at Scala (which also has an actor library in the<br />
standard distribution, as well as the more advanced <a href="http://akkasource.org/">Akka</a>-library), don&#8217;t<br />
judge Scala as being a competitor for Erlang, they&#8217;re both completely<br />
different languages targeting different applications. &#8216;Scala&#8217; is not<br />
about &#8216;scalability&#8217; as Erlang is (it&#8217;s a &#8220;Scalable Language&#8221;).</p>
<li>
<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/"><em>F#</em></a> (and most likely <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/"><em>OCaml</em></a> as well, although I never used it though) is<br />
certainly worth a look as well. I only read 3/4th of a book on it, but<br />
it looks really promising and interesting.</p>
<li>
<p>There&#8217;s obviously all sorts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)"><em>Lisp</em></a> dialects. I have no opinion on<br />
them, never looked into any Lisp closely enough. I only wrote some<br />
<a href="http://clojure.org/"><em>Clojure</em></a> (a Lisp-dialect for the JVM) code one day, but need to learn<br />
more about the Lisp-way of programming. Clojure seems to be interesting<br />
because of the deep integration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">Software Transactional Memory</a> (STM)<br />
in the language (yet another approach to concurrency <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ).</p>
</ul>
<p>As for the IDE question: <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and a decent terminal are all you need,<br />
luckily none of the above languages require you to learn how to use a<br />
toolchain which enforces you (or some magic IDE) to write 500 lines of<br />
XML-based build &#8216;programs&#8217; or other insanities.</p>
<p>My advice: pick some language, learn it, but make sure you don&#8217;t only<br />
learn the language, but especially the concepts (type system,<br />
higher-order stuff, list manipulation,&#8230;). Then pick some other<br />
language and learn it as well (which will be easier since you got the<br />
concepts already) and so on.</p>
<p>And read tons of papers available on the internet in between <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Even if<br />
you don&#8217;t understand a paper completely, you&#8217;ll pick up some things<br />
already, and re-reading it 2 weeks later helps a lot <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Just my .02,</p>

	<div class="entry-content full-content">
<p>As mentioned <a href="book-review-python-testing-beginners-guide/index.html">before</a>, some days ago I received a copy of a recent book from <em>Packt Publishing</em> titled <strong><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/python-testing-beginners-guide/book?utm_source=eikke.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_002562">&#8220;Python Testing &#8211; Beginner&#8217;s Guide&#8221;</a></strong> by <em>Daniel Arbuckle</em>. I read the whole book (it&#8217;s not huge, around 220 pages), and wrote a review, as requested by Packt.</p>
<p>The book targets people who know Python (it doesn&#8217;t contain a language introduction chapter or something alike, which would be rather pointless anyway), and want to start testing the code they write. Even though the author starts by explaining basic tools like <em>doctests</em> and the <em>unittest</em> framework contained in the Python standard library, it could be a useful read even if you used these tools before, e.g. when the Mock library is explained, or in the chapter on web application testing using Twill.</p>
<p>The text is easy to read, and contains both hands-on code examples, explanations as well as tasks for the reader and quiz questions. I did not audit all code for correctness (although in my opinion some more time should have been invested here before the book was publishing: some code samples contain errors, even invalid syntax (p45: &#8220;<code>self.integrated_error +q= err * delta</code>&#8220;), which is not what I expect in a book about code testing), nor all quizes. These could&#8217;ve used some more care as well, e.g. on p94 one can read</p>
<blockquote><p>What is the unittest equivalent of this doctest?</p>
<pre><code>>>> try:
...     int('123')
... except ValueError:
...     pass
... else:
...     print 'Expected exception was not raised'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I was puzzled by this, since as far as I could remember, int(&#8217;123&#8242;) works just fine, and I didn&#8217;t have a computer at hand to check. Checked now, and it works as I expected, so maybe I&#8217;m missing something here? The solution found in the back of the book is a literal <em>unittest</em>-port of the above <em>doctest</em>, and should fail, if I&#8217;m not mistaken:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>>>> def test_exceptions(TestCase):
...     def test_ValueError(self):
...         self.assertRaises(ValueError, int, '123')
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This example also shows one more negative point of the book, IMHO: the code samples don&#8217;t follow <strong>PEP-8</strong> (or similar) capitalization, which makes code rather hard to read sometimes.</p>
<p>The solutions for the last quiz questions are missing as well, and accidently I did want to read those.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be mistaken though: these issues don&#8217;t reduce the overall value of the book, it&#8217;s certainly worth your time, as long as you keep in mind not to be too confused by the mistakes as shown above.</p>
<h3>Topic overview</h3>
<p>The book starts with a short overview of types of testing, including unit, integration and system testing, and why testing is worth the effort. This is a very short overview of 3 pages.</p>
<p>Starting from chapter 2, the <em>doctest</em> system is introduced. I think it&#8217;s an interesting approach to start with <em>doctest</em> instead of using <em>unittest</em>, which is modeled after the more &#8216;standard&#8217; xUnit packages. Doctests are useful during specification writing as well, which is in most project the first stage, before any unittestable code is written. The chapter also introduces an overview of the <em>doctest</em> directives, which was useful to read.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 gives an example of the development of a small project, and all stages involved, including how doctests fit in every stage.</p>
<p>Maybe a sample of <strong>Sphinx</strong> and its <em>doctest</em> integration would have been a nice addition to one of the previous chapters, since the book introduced <em>doctest</em> as part of stand-alone text files, not as part of code docstrings (although it does talk about those as well). When writing documentation in plain text files, Sphinx is certainly the way to go, and its <em>doctest</em> plugin is a useful extra.</p>
<p>Starting in chapter 4, the Python &#8216;<em>mocking</em>&#8216; library is introduced. The chapter itself is a rather good introduction to mock-based testing, but I don&#8217;t think mocks should be used in doctests, which should be rather small, examplish snippets. Mock definitions don&#8217;t belong there, IMO. This chapter also shows some lack of pre-publishing reviews in a copy-paste error, in the block explaining how to install mocker on page 62, telling from now on Nose is ready to be used.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, which you can read <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/files/8846-python-testing-beginners-guide-sample-chapter-5-when-doctest-isnt-enough-unittest-to-the-rescue.pdf">here</a> introduces the <em>unittest</em> framework, its assertion methods, fixtures and mocking integration.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 &#8216;<em>nose</em>&#8216; is introduced, a tool to find and run tests in a project. I use nose myself in almost every project, and it&#8217;s certainly a good choice. The chapter gives a pretty good overview of the useful features nose provides. It does contain a strange example of module-level setup and teardown methods, whilst IMHO subclassing <em>TestCase</em> would be more suited (and more portable).</p>
<p>Chapter 7 implements a complete project from specification to implementation and maintenance. Useful to read, but I think the chapter contains too much code, and it&#8217;s repeated too often.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 introduces web application testing using Twill, which I never used before (nor did I ever test a web application before). Useful to read, but Twill might be a strange choice, since there have been no releases since end 2007&#8230; Selenium might have been a better choice?</p>
<p>A large part of the chapter is dedicated to list all possible Twill commands as well, which I think is a waste of space, this can be easily found in the Twill language reference.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 introduces integration and system testing. Interesting to read, the diagram-drawing method used is certainly useful, but it also contains too much code listings.</p>
<p>Finally, chapter 10 gives a short overview of some other testing tools. First <em>coverage.py</em> is explained, which is certainly useful. Then integration of test execution with version control systems is explained. I think this is certainly useful, but not at this level of detail. Setting up a Subversion repository is not exactly what I expect here, especially not when non-anonymous, password-based authentication over svn:// is used (which is a method which should be avoided, AFAIK).<br />
Finally, continuous integration using Buildbot is tackled. No comments here, although I tend to use Hudson myself <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<h3>Final words</h3>
<p>Is this book worth your time and money? If you&#8217;re into Python and you don&#8217;t have lots of experience with testing Python code, it certainly is. Even if you wrote tests using unittest or doctests before, you&#8217;ll most likely learn some new things, like using mocks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad Packt gave me the opportunity to read and review the book. I&#8217;d advise them to put some more effort in pre-publishing reviews for future titles, but the overall quality of the non-code content was certainly OK, and I hope lots of readers will enjoy and learn from this book.</p>

	<div class="entry-content full-content">
<p>Recently a new book on software testing in Python projects was published by Packt Publishing, &#8220;Python Testing: Beginner&#8217;s Guide&#8221;. I&#8217;ll read the book the coming weeks (it didn&#8217;t arrive yet) and publish a review later on.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re into Python software development, you might want to take a look at the book <a title="Python Testing: Beginner's Guide" href="http://www.packtpub.com/python-testing-beginners-guide/book?utm_source=eikke.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_002562">webpage</a>, or download a free <a title="When Doctest isn't Enough: Unittest to the Rescue" href="http://www.packtpub.com/files/8846-python-testing-beginners-guide-sample-chapter-5-when-doctest-isnt-enough-unittest-to-the-rescue.pdf">chapter</a> (PDF) about the standard Python <em>unittest</em> package for now.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not a big fan of extensive/exaggerated unit testing and rather believe in functional/component tests, I&#8217;m looking forward to read the book and learn some new things. Looking forward to the web application testing chapter, among others.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I was invited by Packt Publishing to review this book, and they provide a free copy.</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been into <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> lately. More about it will follow later, but there&#8217;s something I found out which I really like.</p>
<p>Last couple of days I wrote some very basic Scala snippets, containing constructs which would be non-trivial or &#8216;unusual&#8217; to write in <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>, compile it to a class file, and then use a <a href="http://java.decompiler.free.fr/">Java decompiler</a> to figure out how the Scala compiler maps those constructs to JVM bytecodes.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one thing which took my attention: looks like (basic) tail-recursive functions are optimized into while-loops! This only happens if the last call of a function is a call to itself (the most basic form of tail recursion), but it&#8217;s an interesting feature anyway&#8230; No more need to put socket accept handling in an infinite while loop <img src='http://eikke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />

	<div class="entry-content full-content">
<p>Recently I worked on some new project, and as always I created a local <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repository as a start. After working on it several days, creating lots of commits, I had to publish it into the central <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository (which is one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control_system">VCS</a>s we got). I could have done this by creating a new folder in SVN and add the latest version of all files of the project to it, but that way all history would be gone, which I didn&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>Git has a feature to work with SVN repositories, <em>git-svn</em>, but that&#8217;s intended to check out existing code from SVN and work on it, not publishing an existing Git tree into a Subversion repository.</p>
<p>A first rather naive approach didn&#8217;t work out (as somewhat expected), but then I figured out how to achieve this anyway.<br />

I started to write this as a comment on his post, but it turned out much longer, so sending it over here in the end.)</p>
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>As discussed before, this is not a fair comparison, since the non-recursive version is much &#8216;smarter&#8217; than the recursive one: it calculates values and will never recalculates them, whilst the recursive version calculates everything over and over again.</p>
<p>Adding some simple memoization helps a lot. First, my testing code:<br />

<p>Some weeks ago I attended <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/" title="JavaOne">JavaOne</a> (a pretty neat conference, even for non-Java-heads like me) and got in touch with several non-Java languages running on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine" title="Wikipedia - Java Virtual Machine"><abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr></a> (nothing really new next to <a href="http://projectfortress.sun.com/Projects/Community" title="Project Fortress">Project Fortress</a>, but I never got into most for real).</p>
<p>Since I wanted to learn some language not resembling any other I already know (even a little), I decided some hours ago to start digging into Clojure, which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP" title="Wikipedia - LISP"><abbr title="LISt Processing">LISP</abbr></a> dialect running on the JVM using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory" title="Wikipedia - Software transactional memory"><abbr title="Software Transactional Memory">STM</abbr></a> (Software Transactional Memory) and created with concurrency in mind.
