		<description>Exaplananation is great, but I can&#039;t access the diagrams. How can i access diagrams? I am really interested in this subject</description>

		<description>@Anonymous: it might take some time until I finish next article(s), exams here.

@Thomas: I&#039;ll look for it. I was just guessing, the angle where you got a good view (ie well-focused) looked quite small to me (but maybe it was too late in the evening ;-))

Maybe I&#039;m understanding something wrong, but I think your &#039;sheet of paper&#039; example is wrong, as the angle it proves to be visible is depending on both the width of the paper, and the distance between your eyes and the paper...

@John: obviously, check yesterday&#039;s post I link to at the top of this article.

@Joachim: object tracking in picture sequences isn&#039;t that easy, unless the tracked object is really distinct from other parts of the image. For the wiimote it&#039;s much easier: there&#039;ll most likely be only one IR source around, where the IR light could even be of some specific wave length (inside some range, that is). Normal webcams don&#039;t register (or filter) IR light from the visual though, before sending it to the PC, afaik. Maybe I should dig up my old webcam and check whether there are any good Linux drivers by now, and play around with it a little :-)</description>

		<description>Woudn’t it be possible to get the same result with a regular webcam, if you put something easily detectable on your forehead (big colored dots)? Or is the the crucial part of the wiimote the detection speed?</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve read somewhere that the human angle of vision is considered to be approximately 120/130°. 

You&#039;d need to check a more accurate source than my rememberings, but the human field of view is definitely more than 90° : just put the corner of a blank sheet of paper under your nose, you will easily see far beyond the edge of the sheet on the sides.</description>

		<description>I find this subject quite interesting, and I personally would *love* to see the math, trig and all.  I&#039;d also love to see your explanation of the head-tracking math.</description>
