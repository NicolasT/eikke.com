		<description>The trigraphs were added so that people using keyboards lacking some of the characters needed for C programming could enter them, instead of having characters in their own languages being used as separators.

As I remember, the Danes said they would not vote for the C++ standard unless trigraphs were included.  Ironically, that is Bjarne Stroustrup&#039;s homeland.</description>

		<description>litb, that&#039;s wrong. I think you meant

  printf(”%d”, 0[i]);

Although it looks almost right, since &#039;i&#039; is usually used for indices.</description>

		<description>Looks like some people might have misread the title, it says &#039;Funky C&#039;, not &#039;Funny C&#039;. I wouldn&#039;t like to maintain code containing this myself, at all :-)</description>

		<description>tho it&#039;s not funny, you could add
printf(&quot;%d&quot;, [i]0);</description>

		<description>They taught us C trigraphs at university during introductory C courses less than ten years ago. (wow, though, I actually learned C before C99 had been adopted as by ANSI.) Using a combination of digraphs and trigraphs in the same file is of course eeeeeevil.

		<description>No, it&#039;s not funny at all, if you have to compile legacy code that relies on this and other deformities. (especially if it&#039;s things that gcc has deprecated since a long time, and removed...)</description>
