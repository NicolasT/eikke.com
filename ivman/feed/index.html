		<description>Hi Nicolas, 

I&#039;m Stefan, from the StartUp weekend.  The group I joined, Kodesk won the prize and we decided to go on with the project. We need a developper in our team and your work at MealInOne impressed me and will for sure be interesting for the rest of the team. Are you willing to join a team of 4 dedicated people to launch the project. If you&#039;re interested, please contact me to send you more details about the project. Otherwise, if you know someone in your network that could be interested, it would be really kind of you to let us know.  On behalf of Dann Rogge, Elly Wynants, Sebastian Muhl.</description>
